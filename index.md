title: Tory Drugs Contest

_"Which drugs will the UK's next prime minister have taken?"_ ---
unless you count wheat,
it's not something the UK had to think about last time round,
in the contest Theresa May eventually ended up not losing
("winning" might be too string a word).
But today there is out-and-out abundance of choice
should Conservative MPs and members be looking for candidates who
have confirmed taking/smoking/sneezing/drinking illegal
--- in the UK (maybe... I'll check?) ---
drugs.
As far as the author is aware,
no bookies are offering odds
on which drugs exactly will win the Tory leadership contest,
but with an API or two and a bit of javascript
that really ought not be a problem any longer.

_Sorry, I can't be bothered not to build this in production... so it doesn't actually do anything yet._
